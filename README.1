.TH VAYERX-GENTOO 8
.SH NAME
vayerx-gentoo - overlay for Gentoo Linux used by Vasiliy Yeremeyev.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This overlay is used for personal hacking of Gentoo Linux: addition of unofficial/unsupported ebuilds, masking/unmasking according to personal preferences and so on.
.SH INSTALLATION
Installation is rather simple: all you have to do is to register new overlay in your system. Additonally, you may want to add symlinks to Documentation/package.{keywords,mask,unmask}/*.
.SS Installation via layman
You will need \fBapp-portage/layman\fP installed:
.br
.B emerge -avq app-portage/layman
.sp
\fBvayerx-gentoo\fP isn't in the official overlays list - just add overlays.xml from the root of \fBvayerx-gentoo\fP:
.br
.B layman -o https://github.com/vayerx/vayerx-gentoo/raw/master/overlays.xml -a vayerx
.br
.I Layman may ignore '--overlay' option. Workaround: you can add https://github.com/vayerx/vayerx-gentoo/raw/master/overlays.xml to 'overlays' section in /etc/layman/layman.cfg and refetch overlays to put them to layman's cache.
.sp
Don't forget to add '\fBsource /var/lib/layman/make.conf\fP' to the /etc/make.conf
