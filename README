NAME
       vayerx-gentoo - overlay for Gentoo Linux used by Vasiliy Yeremeyev

DESCRIPTION
       This  overlay is used for personal hacking of Gentoo Linux: addition of
       unofficial/unsupported ebuilds, masking/unmasking according to personal
       preferences and so on.

INSTALLATION
       Installation is rather simple: all you have to is to register new over‐
       lay in your system. Additonally, you may want to add symlinks to  Docu‐
       mentation/package.{mask,unmask}/vayerx.

   Installation via layman
       You will need app-portage/layman installed.
       emerge -avq app-portage/layman

       vayerx-gentoo  isn't  yet in the overlays list (repositories.xml). Just
       add overlay from overlays.xml in the root of vayerx-gentoo:
       layman   -o    https://github.com/vayerx/vayerx-gentoo/raw/master/over‐
       lays.xml -a vayerx
       Layman   may   ignore  '--overlay'  option.  Workaround:  you  can  add
       https://github.com/vayerx/vayerx-gentoo/raw/master/overlays.xml      to
       'overlays'  section  in  /etc/layman/layman.cfg and refetch overlays to
       put them to layman's cache.

       Don't  forget  to  add  'source   /var/lib/layman/make.conf'   to   the
       /etc/make.conf

   Manual installation
       Go to wherever you want to add overlay. Example:
       cd /var/lib/layman

       Clone git repository.
       git clone https://github.com/vayerx/vayerx-gentoo.git vayerx

       Register overlay in PORTDIR_OVERLAY in the /etc/make.conf.
       PORTDIR_OVERLAY="$PORTDIR_OVERLAY /var/lib/layman/vayerx
